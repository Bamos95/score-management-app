## Admin Access

The admin area login information is:

- Email: admin@gmail.com
- Password: Admin@@12

To add a new admin, modify the [user] table in the database. Change the [userGroup] attribute from 'sample' to 'admin'.

## Environment Configuration

- PHP (version 7.4 or higher)
- MySQL (version 5.7 or higher)
- Web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: https://github.com/Bamos95/score-management-app

2. Import the database from the `sportscores.sql` file.

3. Configure the database connection by modifying the [dbConnect()] function in the [method.php] file as follows:

   - $DB_USER = '[your-username]';
   - $DB_PASS = '[your-password]';

## Usage

1. Start your server.

2. Launch the project.

When the application is running, you can schedule and manage matches in real-time, as well as track scores and statistics.

## Data Security

Ensuring data security is a top priority for us. We have implemented encryption and authentication measures to protect the integrity of the scores and prevent any unauthorized access.
